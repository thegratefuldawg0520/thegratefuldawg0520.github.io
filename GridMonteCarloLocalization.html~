                    <p>The Extended Kalman Filter is a viable means of pose tracking given a reliable initial estimate of its position and orientation within a known environment and coordinate system. When these initial estimates are unknown, or the assumptions of uni-modal gaussian distributions and model linearity are invalid, an appeal must be made to non-parametric localization techniques. These non-parametric techniques can be characterized by numerous benefits:
		
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Raw sensor data can be processes rather than relying on feature detection</li>

				<li>They are non-parametric and not bound to a particular distribution</li>

				<li>They can solve the global localization problem. In addition, they can solve the kidnapped robot problem under certain conditions</li>
			</ul>

                    <p>Two non-parametric methods of interest are the grid based histogram filter and the monte carlo based particle filter, both of which can be used to estimate the position and orientation of a robot in a known environment. </p>
                    

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Grid Localization</h2>

                    <p>Grid localization is performed by decomposing the pose space into a discrete grid over all valid poses. The granularity, or resolution, of the position and orientation estimates dictates the tradeoff between approximation precision and computational requirements. </p>

                    <p>In discrete state space, the histogram filter is referred to as the Discrete Bayes Filter. In this case there are a finite number of states the random variable(s) characterizing the system may take on. Each state is assigned a probability estimate by performing a prediction step given the prior estimate(s) and current control commands, followed by a measurement step in which each the posterior distribution of each state is estimated given the most recent measurements.</p>

                    <p>In continuous state space, the histogram filter decomposes the state space into finitely many regions. Such a decomposition can be coarse or fine grained, depending on the magnitude of the acceptable approximation errors and the computational capacity of the system. The state of the system is then a piecewise approximation of the state at each region.</p>
                    
                    <p>Continuous states can be decomposed statically, in which the state space is decomposed into a fixed form regardless of the estimated posterior distribution, or it can be decomposed dynamically, in which the state space is decomposed into a form that varies based upon the resources required to estimate the posterior distribution. Density trees, for instance, are a dynamic decomposition technique that generate coarse decompositions for regions in state space with low likelihoods, and fine decompositions for regions with higher likelihoods. Selective updating is another method of dynamically updating only a subset of the state space decomposition in which variation is likely to have occurred. In this technique only a fraction of the prior estimates for the gridded state space is updated based upon a certain criteria, such as regions with a high posterior probability. The state space itself can be represented in a graph-like topological form, or in a gridded metric form.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Particle Filter</h2>

                    <p>The Particle Filter is another nonparametric filter that can be used when no assumptions of linearity or gaussianity can be made. In this method, particles refer to randomly drawn samples from the posterior distribution generating a hypothesis of the true world state. It generates such samples recursively by sampling the prior distribution from the previous estimation epoch, and propagates the sample to the current estimation epoch using the system and measurement models. The particle filter works as follows:</p>
                    
                    	<ol>
                    		<li>A hypothetical state is generated based upon the prior state and the control input for each particle.</li>
                    		<li>An importance factor is generated based upon how well each hypothetical state fits the observations given the measurement model. This importance factor is then used to weight the hypothetical states</li>
                    		<li>A resampling step occurs in which a new set of particles is drawn from the set of hypothetical states given the importance factor. This step allows the new set of particles to be focused around regions of the hypothetical distribution with a higher probability.</li>
                    	</ol>
                    	
                    	<p>As the particle filter generates a state estimate based on an approximation of the target distribution, it suffers from several approximation errors:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Due to the finite number of particles, when the resampling step occurs, and the weights are normalized to 1, reducing the degrees of freedom of the weights to one less than the number of particles used. This is because now the final weight becomes a function of 1 minus the sum of the other weights.</li>
								<li>Random error is introduced due to the random nature of the resampling phase. This is also known as the variance of the estimator: when the variance of the particle set decreases, the variance with respect to the best estimate increases.</li>
								<li>The divergence between the target distribution and the proposal distribution. Since the proposal distribution results after the system model step, and the target distribution, or the posterior distribution, is determined after the integration of new observations, this error can manifest when the system model is not well known and the sensor observations are very accurate</li>
								<li>A fourth error is referred to as particle deprevation, or not having a sufficient number of particles to cover all relevant regions within the state space with a high likelihood of occurence. This can result in no particle being within the vicinity of the correct state.</li>
							</ol>
