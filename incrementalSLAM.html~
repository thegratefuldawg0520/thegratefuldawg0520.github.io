                    <p>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the process of simultaneously estimating the position and orientation (pose) of one or more cameras, in addition to the locations of all observed features, within a pre-defined coordinate system. This process can be carried out in one of two different ways: full SLAM and online SLAM. Full SLAM is the process of simultaneously estimating all image poses, and the positions of all observed features, within a collection of overlapping images. This is also referred to as the bundle adjustment in the photogrammetric literature. This can be contrasted to online SLAM in which camera poses and object feature locations are estimated incrementally as new images become available.</p>
                    
                    <p>Within the context of both SLAM problems, one major task is to estimate a feature based map of the environment under observation. A feature based map consists of a set of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines, polygons) and an associated descriptor that is meant to uniquely characterize the primitive allowing it to be distinguished from other primitives within the map. The locations of these observed geometric primatives can be related to the pose of one or more cameras via the imposition of conditions of collinearity or coplanarity, affording the ability to simultaneously localize and map. The full parameterization of this problem is referred to as the combined state vector, and is typically modelled as a non-linear system with gaussian noise.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">EKF SLAM</h2>

                    <p>The Extended Kalman Filter is the classical method of Online SLAM which provides a moments based representation of the SLAM problem in terms of the state vector and state covariance matrix. The goal of EKF SLAM is to simultaneously estimate the camera pose at each epoch in addition to a growing map of observed feature based landmark locations. Initially, as only a small number of features are observed, the complexity of the problem is relatively small. As the number of observed features in the map grows, so too does the number of features modelled within the combined state vector and state covariance matrix, increasing the computational complexity of the algorithm. Additionally, the fully populated structure of the state covariance matrix results in a fully populated Kalman Gain eliminating the ability to use sparse linear algebra techniques to expedite the computations. Finally, as each state estimate is recursively dependant upon the prior estimate, divergence between the estimated value and the expected value of the state diverges over time due to linearization errors, initialization point, outlier observations, approximate nature of the linearization point, and violations of the gaussian assumption regarding the form posterior distribution of the state estimate.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">EIF SLAM</h2>
                    
                    <p>The Extended Information Filter is a duality of the EKF. It provides a canonical representation of the state of the system in terms of the information vector and information matrix. Unlike the EKF, which is suited to solving the online SLAM problem, the EIF is better suited to solving the full SLAM problem. Further, the sparse band-diagonal form of the information matrix allows for sparse linear algebra techniques to be applied to its efficient inversion. As the information vector and information matrix are dualities of the state vector and covariance matrix, it is possible to transform between the moments representation and the canonical representation of the system, allowing for computations to be carried out in the information space, while generating solutions in terms of the state space parameterization. In practice it can be computationally difficult to recover the full covariance matrix from the information matrix, thus instead it is possible to recover marginal covariances related to each of the individual localization and mapping estimates</p>                  
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Sparse Extended Information Filter</h2>
                    
                    <p>The Sparse Extended Information Filter is an augmented version of the EIF that allows for online estimation of the SLAM problem while simultaneously taking advantage of the sparsity of the information matrix. </p>
